<!-- Have cells-list component be nestable for sub-cells -->

<!-- individual cell components MUST NOT assume they are in a tree node
  They could be in properties sheet or in options popup, etc.
  So they must be in separate module(s)

  Cell MUST NOT assume that it has anything to do with columns.

  SOME cells/cell-components must be able to handle display of aggregate values (e.g. minMidMax or at the numeric cell level, time-tracking)
    and missing child values
