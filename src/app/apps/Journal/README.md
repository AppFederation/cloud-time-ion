Ideas:

Quantified self.

Habit/mood tracking.

Self-accountability without the need to embarrass or explain ones self to someone else or bother them.


Will have a lot of different varying reminders, daily or at key points in the day:

- C'mon, one minute now, to save You hours and years!
- Get out of the autopilot, and get mindful by forcing yourself to get out of denial (OR record the very good state You have right now)
